# WorkoutProgrammer

When I was working as full time Personal Trainer I was thinking about creating the app which will help with creating and adjusting training plans for my clients. 
There was an idea but no skill to do it by myself.

Finally in 2020 I decided to change my profession to something what I always wanted to do. Apart from that I enjoy to train hard and be active I also love to spend time on front of computer. I feel constant need to feed my brain with new stuff and found that it's perfectly works with programming.

After few months of studying here it is -> my first, created from nothing, from chaos in my head -> Workout Programmer.

It's not the app which I planned to create in past but I think it's also great. 
At the beggining of this project, my goal was just to test of HTML/CSS/JS functionalities. I mean by that "if you click this, do sth etc...".
So I decided to create an App which will create complete Full Body Workout.
You cound choose what kind of workout you are willing to do: STRENGTH or Endurance, and it was manipulate Sets and Reps of exercises.

Then I decided to allow user to choose what exercise he wants to do for a specyfic body area. So I added random exercise buttons on left.

Next step was to choose Intensity and it was dependable from normal sets or supersets.
Let me explain. 
When you write training plan every exercise has it Letter next to it which means it order.

Normal Sets:
A) Exercise One
B) Exercise Two
C) Exercise Three

It means you are doing all sets and reps exercise One, and onced finished go to Exercise Two.Then you do all sets and reps exercise Two - > start Exercise Three. 

Super Sets: 
A1)
A2)
B)
C)

It means that you do exercises A1 and A2 in one Set. Lets say you have to do 3 sets of 10 reps -> you do 10 reps of A1 then 10s rest and do 10 reps of A2 <- It's called superset. Once finished all sets of A1&A2 you will do exercise B).

So by selecting Regular or Supersets you can change the record of order exercises.

For those whos not familiar with exercises I created feature which presents images of exercises. To check how exercise suppose to looks like you have to click on it's name.
Also I added button Super Pump which extends list of exercises by 2. It's adding 2 exercises for ARMS (biceps, triceps.

Next step was extension of my beggining idea. App won't allow you only to generate workout but also use training routine which was already created. 
For now available it's only CHEST SPLIT routine. To get access to it click SPLIT -> Chest. 
New button above table appeared -> Random Workout. I prepared 3 effective chest routines. 
In future I plan to add more training routines. As I'm big fan of "health training" so there will be workouts to fix back, knee pain etc...

Then I focused on design. Which at the beggining was .... Yeahh..I...know ... ok It just was there.
But I added another feature -> button Super Endurance. It adds 2 more exercises slots filled with .... yes endurance exercises.
Once you will decite to perform whole routine with extended Pump and Endurance exercises probably you will "die" that day, but I encourage you to give it a try. 

Design 9

Design ... yeah still not there. Then I added description of Split-Chest routine. It gives you basic knowledge about specyfic muscle group.

Design 10

Here we are. App gets new colors !. Do you liked it ?

Design 12

Yeah still to much birght colors. Let our eyes rest, let's change it to darker one.

Design 13

There is no good training at the gym without girls on gym floor. Main image swapped !



What is important to me it's not just a regular clicker. Every click makes sense here-> every exercise has it proper place. Whole workout is compatible with professional training standards and it's provides complex training routine (full body workouts works on all our joints).





I decided to create this app as it was my old dream to do it.
