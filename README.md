# WorkoutProgrammer

When I was working as full time Personal Trainer I was planing on crating an app which would be a great tool of designing and adjusting workout plans for my clients. Idea was there, but no skills in that field to proceed.  <br>

The way 2020 has turned out, gave me all the time and facilities to develop a new career path in the field I normally played around as a hobby. Active lifestyle, heavy lifting and being in shape is the lifestyle I love the most, but I was always curios in I.T fields, therefore I treated it as a side hobby. I feel a constant hunger of progression and developing therefore to keep my brain as occupied as my body, I started playing around programming.<br>

And now, I would love to share with YOU, the end product of my latest months work! fro the chaos and just what was only an idea - "Workout Programmer".<br>

It's not the app which I planned to create in past but I think it's also great. <br>
At the beginning of this project my goal was just to test the HTML/CSS/JS functionalities, therefore I decided to create an app which create complete full body workout.  <br>

So I decided to create an App which will create complete Full Body Workout.<br>

1.
First feature allows user to choose what kind of workout he's willing to do: STRENGTH or Endurance, and it was manipulate Sets and Reps of exercises.

2.
Then I decided to allow user to choose what exercise he wants to do for a specyfic body area. So I added random exercise buttons on left.

3.
Next step was to choose Intensity and it was dependable from normal sets or supersets.<br>
Let me explain. <br>
When you write training plan every exercises has a Letter next to it which means it order.<br>

Normal Sets:<br>
A) Exercise One<br>
B) Exercise Two<br>
C) Exercise Three<br>

It means you are doing all sets and reps exercise One, and onced finished go to Exercise Two.Then you do all sets and reps exercise Two - > start Exercise Three. 

Super Sets: <br>
A1)<br>
A2)<br>
B)<br>
C)<br>

It means that you do exercises A1 and A2 in one Set. Lets say you have to do 3 sets of 10 reps -> you do 10 reps of A1 then 10s rest and do 10 reps of A2 <- It's called superset. Once finished all sets of A1&A2 you will do exercise B).<br>

So by selecting Regular or Supersets you can change the record of order exercises.<br>

4.
For those whos not familiar with exercises I created feature which presents images of exercises. To check how the exercises meant to be completed correctly, user would click on it's name.<br>
Also I added button Super Pump which extends list of exercises by 2. It's adding 2 exercises for ARMS (biceps, triceps. <br>

5.
NExt step was to extend my idea from the beginning, To develop it more.<br> App won't allow you only to generate workout but also use training routine which was already created. <br>
At this very time, user can only choose chest split routine To get access to it click SPLIT -> Chest. <br>
New button above table appeared -> Random Workout. I prepared 3 effective chest routines. <br>
In future I plan to add more training routines. As I'm big fan of "health training" so there will be workouts to fix back pain, knee pain etc...<br>

6.
Then I focused on design. Which at the beggining was .... Yeahh..I...know ...ok it was just there.<br>
But I added another feature -> button Super Endurance. It adds 2 more exercises slots filled with .... yes endurance exercises.<br>
Once you will decite to perform whole routine with extended Pump and Endurance exercises probably you will "die" that day, but I encourage you to give it a try. <br>

Then I added description of Split-Chest routine. It gives you basic knowledge about specyfic muscle group.<br>

10.
There is no good training at the gym without girls on gym floor. Main image swapped !<br>
Ok so you have created you own workout and now what ? <br>
New feature - Copy Workout button. Click it -> then paste to google sheets, messenger, email or whereever. Done <3 Sweet.<br>

11.
I know it's not so user friendly (you have to read before click) but I created the Welcome message which explains how to use app. <br>

12.
What is most important to me it's not just a regular clicker app. Every click makes sense here-> every exercise has it proper place. Whole workout is compatible with professional training standards and it's provides complex training routines (full body workouts works on all our joints).<br>

If u are persistent and you reached to this point. <br>
Please give it a go, do some click, Copy workout , paste and give it a try at the gym floor.<br>
Enjoy.<br>
